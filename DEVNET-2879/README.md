# Get Out of the 90s - Modern Troubleshooting with Cisco APIs and Splunk

This repository includes the supplemental material for the Cisco Live DevNet session: DEVNET-2879. Here you can find the code and SPL queries for the demos that were delivered during the session.

The SPL queries executed against the data can be read [in spl_examples.md](spl_examples.md). Note that the SPL is written specifically for the data used in the demos. To get similar data into your Splunk, you can utilize the scripted inputs shared in this repository, as well as define webhooks and syslog as covered during the session.
